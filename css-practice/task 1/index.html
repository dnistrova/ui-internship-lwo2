        <p>When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed collaborators.
          All aspects of our software development process are integrated, iterative and agile.</p>

        <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to
          understand your product vision.
          The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.
          Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <div class=text>
          <p>All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web development technologies.

        <h3>Product Management</h3>
        <div class=text>
          <p>Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the products we build
            are always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.</p>
